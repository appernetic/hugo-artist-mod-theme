    Highlights = "<p>Tezos is a security-minded, future-proof, smart contract platform. It features a built-in governance mechanism that gives stakeholders the power to make decisions on protocol upgrades which are automatically pushed on the blockchain. In addition, Tezos features a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and a smart contract language designed to facilitate formal verification. This ensures that changes to the software happen in a safe, secure, and transparent way without the risk of hard forks.</p><p>With a protocol written in OCaml and a new smart contract language called Michelson, Tezos makes security and nonambiguity our top concern.</p><p>For more information please review our:</p>- [White paper](https://github.com/tezos/tezos)<br>- [Position paper](https://tezos.com/pdf/position_paper.pdf)<br>- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/tezos/)"
